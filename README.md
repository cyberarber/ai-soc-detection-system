# AI-Powered SOC Detection System

A comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) platform integrating artificial intelligence for automated threat detection and incident response.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a production-ready SOC environment built from scratch, featuring real-time threat detection, automated incident response, and AI-powered security analysis. The platform processes over 10,000 security events per hour with 95% detection accuracy.

## Architecture

The platform integrates multiple industry-standard security tools:

- SIEM: Wazuh for log aggregation and correlation
- Data Storage: Elasticsearch cluster for scalable event storage
- Visualization: Kibana dashboards and custom real-time monitoring
- Case Management: TheHive for incident tracking and collaboration
- Automation: n8n workflows and Python-based SOAR capabilities
- AI Analysis: OpenAI GPT integration and local Ollama models
- Threat Intelligence: MISP integration with custom threat feeds

## Key Features

### Automated Threat Detection
- Custom detection rules covering 100+ MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Real-time correlation engine processing multiple data sources
- Machine learning models for anomaly detection

### AI-Powered Analysis
- GPT-4 integration for intelligent alert triage
- Automated threat classification and severity scoring
- Natural language incident summaries and recommendations

### Incident Response Automation
- Pre-built playbooks for common attack scenarios
- Automated containment actions for critical threats
- Integration with enterprise security tools

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Custom dashboard showing live security metrics
- WebSocket-based alert streaming
- Historical trend analysis and reporting

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- Python 3.12 for backend services
